"Zoe": "Hello? Mr Wong? We are the newly hired night shift watchers. I'm Zoe."
Zoe looks to you. You realize she is waiting for your name.
"Player": "My name is RaphaÃ«l Ambrosius Costeau."
An old man with a thin, unimpressive beard, opens the gate and stares at you.
"Wong": "The harbinger of doom."
"Zoe": "What?"
"Wong": "Don't let the zombies break through the gate."
He locks the gate from the outside and leaves the two of you inside the cemetery.
